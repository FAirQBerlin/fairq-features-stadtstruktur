Version: 23.12.0
Authors@R: person("Guido", "Schulz", , "guido.schulz@inwt-statistics.de", role = c("aut", "cre"))
Description: Import city related raw data from fairq_raw database, 
             engineer features and write it to fairq_features database.
             In particular cases features are engineered from already existing
             features. Then the workflow is import from fairq_features, transform,
             load to fairq_features.
